✈️ Flight Management Application Deployment – Airline Company
🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on the end-to-end deployment of a Flight Management Web Application for an airline company using modern DevOps and cloud-native practices. The solution is designed to be scalable, reliable, and automated to support real-time operations in the aviation domain.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Database: MySQL

Version Control: GitHub

CI/CD Tools: Jenkins

Containerization: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes

IaC (Infrastructure as Code): Terraform, Ansible

📈 Key Highlights
🔧 Scalable Architecture: Designed and implemented a cloud-native infrastructure capable of handling real-time airline operations.

⚙️ Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Integrated Jenkins, GitHub, Docker, and Kubernetes to build, test, and deploy automatically.

🧱 Infrastructure Provisioning: Used Terraform to create and manage cloud infrastructure, and Ansible for post-deployment configuration.

⏱️ Performance Boost: Achieved 85% reduction in deployment time, accelerating delivery and reliability of services.

🛡️ Security and Isolation: Leveraged Kubernetes namespaces and security groups to isolate workloads and protect resources.

🧪 Deployment Workflow
Code Commit: Developers push code to GitHub.

CI/CD Trigger: Jenkins pulls code, builds Docker images, and pushes to Docker registry.

Infrastructure Provisioning:

Terraform provisions cloud infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, load balancers, etc.).

Ansible configures the environment (e.g., installs dependencies, sets up web server).

Deployment: Kubernetes deploys containers in production using manifests or Helm charts.

🌐 Architecture Diagram (Optional)
You can include an architecture diagram here if available (e.g., draw.io or Lucidchart screenshot).

📜 How to Run
Prerequisites:
Docker, Terraform, Ansible, kubectl, Jenkins

AWS account (or any cloud provider)

Python environment for backend

Basic Setup:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-management-deployment.git
cd flight-management-deployment

# Provision infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply

# Run Ansible Playbook
ansible-playbook setup.yml

# Build and push Docker image
docker build -t flight-app .
docker push your-repo/flight-app

# Deploy on Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
📤 Outputs
After successful deployment, the application is available via the Application Load Balancer DNS or the Kubernetes Ingress URL.

🔧 Future Improvements
✅ Add HTTPS using ACM + ALB or Ingress TLS

✅ Integrate monitoring with CloudWatch / Prometheus + Grafana

✅ Implement auto-scaling using Kubernetes HPA

✅ Add Blue/Green or Canary deployments
